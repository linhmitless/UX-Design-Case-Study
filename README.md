# UX Design Case Study
### This is a class-assigned project created by a team of 4 Seattle University Computer Science undergraduate students. 

This portfolio details our product design process for the application titled Data Den, from ideation and how we identify customers needs, to research, paper prototypes, mockups, low and high-fidelity wireframes. Through many iterations, each one incorporated more user feedbacks and design testing than the last, we finished the product with a final, complete interactive design and a process blog. 

You can find more details about the project on our website and process blog [here](https://den.data.blog/final-portfolio-data-den/)

Our product design and research process includes:
1. 2 rounds of users interviews 
2. 3 iterations of paper prototypes
3. Mockups (+reviews)
4. Wireframes (+reviews)
5. Final prototype, process blog, presentation
